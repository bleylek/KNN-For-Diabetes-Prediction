KNN For Diabetes Prediction

Project Overview: This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict diabetes diagnosis. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, we aim to accurately determine whether individuals are at risk based on their health data. The model is trained and tested on the diabetes.csv dataset, which includes various health metrics pertinent to diabetes diagnosis.

Dataset: The dataset, diabetes.csv, consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Objective: The primary objective is to predict whether a person will be diagnosed with diabetes based on input variables reflecting their health status. This project highlights the application of KNN in healthcare, demonstrating how machine learning can assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.
